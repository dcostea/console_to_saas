# Conclusions

This book is trying to reproduce as real as possible a use case to get from a prototype to a software as a solution service. This story is not real but is based on our experience and difficulties that we had during this time. The book focuses on following a process and showing some tools to achieve the deliverable and not about implementing the best code practices.

There are more things to consider to have this kind of application in production. We can mention load testing, profiling, and optimization but they are out of the scope of this book. 

While we did our best to make this book as useful as possible and if you think this can be improved, we would highly appreciate your feedback and accept pull requests on GitHub at https://github.com/ignatandrei/console_to_saas/actions.

We hoped you have enjoyed reading as much as we enjoyed writing. If you need help with your software implementations, you can reach us for consultancy services at:

Good luck in your projects!
